fingerprints in a large volume of fingerprint databases during 
investigation. However, by knowing the gender, hands or 
fingers will grossly reduce the time it takes in identifying the

deduced to be either a male or female, the forensic 
investigators will limit the scope of the investigation and
hence speed up the forensic investigation.
